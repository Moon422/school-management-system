## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 18
- NPM or Yarn
- (Optional) Docker (if you want containerization later)

---

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-management-backend.git
cd school-management-backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
````

---

### 🛠️ Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the root with the following:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
JWT_EXPIRES_IN="1d"
```

---

### 🗃️ Run Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This will generate and apply the database schema using SQLite.

---

### 🔧 Run the Development Server

```bash
# Start the app in development mode
npm run start:dev
```

---

### 🧪 Testing (Optional)

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT-based authentication using `@nestjs/passport`
* Role-based authorization using custom decorators and guards
* Use `@Roles('ADMIN')` to protect endpoints by role
